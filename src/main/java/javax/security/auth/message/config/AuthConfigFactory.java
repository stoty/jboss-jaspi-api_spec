/**
 *  <p>This class is used to obtain AuthConfigProvider objects that can be used to
 *  obtain authentication context configuration objects, i.e., ClientAuthConfig and
 *  ServerAuthConfig objects.</p>
 *
 *  <p>Authentication context configuration objects are used to obtain authentication context objects.
 *  Authentication context objects, that is, ClientAuthContext and ServerAuthContex objects, encapsulate authentication modules.
 *  Authentication modules are pluggable components that perform security-related processing of request and response messages.</p>
 *
 *  <p>Callers do not operate on modules directly. Instead they rely on an authentication
 *  context to manage the invocation of modules. A caller obtains an authentication
 *  context by calling the getAuthContext method on a ClientAuthConfig or ServerAuthConfig
 *  obtained from an AuthConfigProvider.</p>
 *
 *  <p>The following represents a typical sequence of calls for obtaining a client
 *  authentication context, and then using it to secure a request.</p>
 *
 *  <ol>
 *      <li>AuthConfigFactory factory = AuthConfigFactory.getFactory();</li>
 *      <li>AuthConfigProvider provider = factory.getConfigProvider(layer,appID,listener);</li>
 *      <li>ClientAuthConfig config = provider.getClientAuthConfig(layer,appID,cbh)</li>
 *      <li>String authContextID = config.getAuthContextID(messageInfo);</li>
 *      <li>ClientAuthContext context = config.getAuthContext(authContextID,subject,properties);</li>
 *      <li>context.secureRequest(messageInfo,subject);</li>
 *  </ol>
 *
 *  <p>A system-wide AuthConfigFactory implementation can be set by invoking
 *  setFactory, and retrieved via getFactory.</p>
 *
 *  <p>Every implementation of this abstract class must offer a public, zero argument
 *  constructor. This constructor must support the construction and registration (including
 *  self-registration) of AuthConfigProviders from a persistent declarative representation.</p>
 *
 *  <p>For example, a factory implementation class could interpret the contents of a
 *  file containing a sequence of configuration entries, with one entry per
 *  AuthConfigProvider, with each entry representing:</p>
 *
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>The fully qualified name of the provider implementation class (or null)</li>
 *      <li>The list of the provider initialization properties (which could be empty)</li>
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  <p>Any provider initialization properties must be specified in a form that can be passed to the provider constructor
 *  within a Map of key, value pairs, and where all keys and values within the Map are of type String.</p>
 *
 *  <p>The entry syntax must also provide for the optional inclusion of information sufficient to define a
 *  RegistrationContext. This information would only be present when the factory will register the provider. For
 *  example, each entry could provide for the inclusion of one or more RegistrationContext objects of the following
 *  form:</p>
 *
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>The message layer name (or null)</li>
 *      <li>The application context identifier (or null)</li>
 *      <li>The registration description (or null)</li>
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  <p>When a RegistrationContext is not included, the factory must make it convenient for the provider to self-register
 *  with the factory during the provider construction (see registerConfigProvider(AuthConfigProvider provider, ...)).</p>
 *
 *  <p>An AuthConfigFactory implementation is free to choose is own persistent declarative syntax as long as it
 *  conforms to the requirements defined by this class.</p>
